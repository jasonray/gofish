Opening in Eclipse
==================
If you use Eclipse, the gradle scripts are nice enough to create your classpath files.

If you have gradle installed, run:
```
gradle eclipseClasspath
```

If you do not have gradle installed, run the gradle wrapper:
```
./g eclipse
```

Now you can import the project into eclipse.
